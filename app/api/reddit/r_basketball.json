        "body": "Hello,\n\nI am looking to get a brand new basketball that is indoor/outdoor and will mainly be used outdoors. I am not interested in a \"pure rubber\" basketball since they aren't comfortable to play with, and in pickup games, no one really likes them, which means it will almost never get used in a pickup.\n\nMy favorite basketball of all time that is indoor/outdoor has been the Molten BG3800 and GF7X. The grip has an amazing feel to it. I like the 12 panel design with the satisfaction of watching the ball spin when shot. and then the longevity Molten basketballs have thanks to its durability. But from my experience as well as others, in pickup basketball, many feel like Molten basketballs are smaller compared to the Wilson, Spalding and Nike basketballs many are used to.\n\nIf you watch this video from a YouTuber named, \"Streetball Strategies\", he measures a men's Molten basketball and 2 men's Spalding basketballs. He explains how the size of the Molten basketball compared to the Spalding basketballs is slightly different even though these are all men's official size 7 basketballs and how it actually matters.\n\nVideo: [Does Difference in Basketball Size Actually Matter?](https://youtu.be/51a6JH-jkrw?si=RQ-FeUpLohK_qwJX)\n\nBased on my experience and this video, this goes to show why many people feel like a size 7 Molten basketball feels small, even though it is actually closer to a 29.5, compared to other brands. Wilson and Spalding are advertised as 29.5, but when measured, are close to 30.0. That half inch makes a difference for many, especially me where I can get too comfortable with my Molten basketball, then have to readjust during a pickup game since most randoms I play with use a Wilson or Spalding rather than Molten since it isn't what they are use to with its smaller feel compared to the other brands.\n\nBased on these previous experiences, I am currently in the search for a new basketball that is indoor/outdoor, can handle concrete courts (especially if used like 2-3 times per week), has a good grip, isn't too light like some basketballs that feel like they are under 20 ounces when they supposed to be 22 ounces, and can last at least a year before replacing it.\n\nThe basketballs that I am considering based on what I found that so far interest me the most or ones I want to know if anyone has experience with are:\n\n\\- [Pattonlex PT7000](https://www.pattonlex.com/products/pt-7000-composite-leather-basketball-official-size-for-indoor-outdoor?variant=46969308872996) (saw so many good reviews on Amazon, and like how it is offered in other colors like Blue. Plus, looks like this will not be too light like some other basketballs I used based on the reviews, and the picture the company sent me of them measuring the basketball's weight on a scale)\n\n\\- [Pro Select Wave Basketball](https://proselectsports.com/product/gb504sv-wave-series-super-fiber-basketball/) (I liked the feel of the original Wilson Wave basketball, and saw some comments from other posts mentioning how this one is good for people who like the Wilson Wave.\n\n\\- [Wilson Staple](https://www.wilson.com/en-us/product/wilson-x-staple-pigeon-grey-bskt-wz40262#colorsteamname=102015) (Always liked the gray color on this one, and looks like it has a comfortable grip)\n\n\\- [Wilson Rhythm](https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/p/wilson-rhythm-basketball-25wiluncrhythmbskbkb/25wiluncrhythmbskbkb?color=Brown) (Found this online while searching, wondered how it is)\n\n\\- [Spalding Excel TF500](https://www.spalding.com/basketball/basketballs/indoor-outdoor/excel-tf500-indoor-outdoor-basketball/SPA0106.html) (Always was interested in this one, but wasn't sure if it would last long)\n\n\\- [Wilson NBA Performance](https://www.bjs.com/product/wilson-nba-performance-edition-basketball/3000000000005426755?fulfillment=shipping) (Had a good experience with this one at a pickup game.

I don't play in ultra-competitive runs anymore, so now its nice to explore basketball from the perspective of a ball dominant player. I spent most of my late teens/early 20s just playing in leagues/pickup for fun and it changed my understanding of the game. I really love the idea of being an unstoppable scorer and being able to control the game with passing and defense. Its fun to set guys up with good shots and be able to serve as the emergency valve when needed. I honestly hated the game a little bit when I quit playing competitively, and being able to explore independently brought back the love permanently.

You want to focus on fundamentals first - I'd suggest that drills that focus on footwork would probably give you the most improvement. \n\nIf you go on YouTube and search \"basketball footwork\", you'll find a lot of helpful videos with drills you can practice. Most of those will give you movements you can practice around the basket, but you can modify those to practice passing as well - instead of shooting, pass the ball against a wall so it will bounce back at you like it's being passed to you, catch it, go into the pivot movements again, pass again, etc. Always pretend you have a defender there you are protecting the ball from - you are trying to build muscle memory here to make your movements faster and more fluid.\n\nSecond best thing to do will be to practice your dribbling - again, YouTube is your friend. You want to focus on fundamentals first - don't worry about crazy crossovers or between the legs stuff yet. One of the best drills to start with is to dribble in place, and slowly start to increase the speed and strength of your dribble until you mess up. As you improve, gradually increase the difficulty of the dribbles - side to side one hand and two hands, back and forth one side then the other, etc. Practice dribbling close to yourself as well as dribbling with your arm extended. Again, this builds muscle memory, as well as strengthens your hands/forearms - a strong fast dribble is one of the most effective and overlooked tools in youth basketball. Everyone wants to practice the fancy stuff, but 99% of the time, that's useless in everything but 1v1. One other protip - practice dribbling with your fingerpads/fingertips, not your palm - again, that goes to developing hand strength, but it gives you MUCH more control over the ball.\n\nAs you improve, you want to incorporate more complex movements into your drills, but ALWAYS remember the fundamentals - even pro NBA players need to keep those up. Steph Curry starts his shooting practice two feet in front of the basket before he starts moving back.\n\nGood luck!",

For example, I have a pretty strong step back shot and side step shot both directions. I use the quick back step or side step to bait the defender to over commit to my shooting hand then I use my offhand foot to push past and get leverage. Also being a strong shooter might have a defender overcommit a close out so you get an easy drive opportunity by pump faking. You could also counter move defenders based off how they are defending you. Somebody who is guarding straight up and has good discipline on their slide is harder to get by, but somebody who starts at an angle to guard a potential drive can be broken down easier because they are already showing their hand by overcommitting to a side.",

Again start off at like 10 in a row and build it up over time. \n\n\nThen play a ton of games against good competition. 1v1 all the way until 5v5. Never play people worse than you if you really want to get good. Only play people better until you are able to beat them then move on to better competition. \n\n\nFor handles look up Steph Curry warm ups and see if you can practice those warm-ups yourself until you get that down completely. \n\n\nAnd defense is the number one thing coaches look for to get you in the game.

Again start off at like 10 in a row and build it up over time. </p>\n\n<p>Then play a ton of games against good competition. 1v1 all the way until 5v5. Never play people worse than you if you really want to get good. Only play people better until you are able to beat them then move on to better competition. </p>\n\n<p>For handles look up Steph Curry warm ups and see if you can practice those warm-ups yourself until you get that down completely. </p>\n\n<p>And defense is the number one thing coaches look for to get you in the game. Defense gets you in the game, offense keeps you in. Remember that and work your but off on defense. </p>\n</div>",

I’m gonna make a guess and say that you play harder in games than you go in practice. Is that true? The harder you go in your training the better your handle will be in games. Nothing can really simulate the live pressure but if you push yourself in practice you will be able to hold on to the ball. Quit being random. Be intentional in your handle practice. If you want to get good at tweens and behinds then do that. Do things progressively. Start by just passing the ball between your legs to each hand. Get faster and faster at that and then keep adding things that make it more difficult. At the end of the day though intensity is where it’s at. Keep pushing yourself to the point you keep losing the ball and work there until you can go faster. Good luck! \n\nAlso look up Gooddrills on YouTube.",

Typical examples of constraints are 3 dribble max but there are better constraints.\n\n\nA better and probably the most importamt constraint is constraining your space. During 1v1 constrain yourself to score within a certain part of the court only, this will simulate help defense. Here is an example: If you divide a half court into 3 parts, constrain yourself to score within 1 of the parts of the court. Change up which part to score from. Change up the starting positions within each of the parts to change up the angle of attack. There several permutations you can go through with this constraint alone\n\nUse time as a constraint. Score within 5 seconds. In a 5v5 you need to be able to score within 5 seconds.\n\nCombine both time and space constraints as another idea to make it even more challenging. This would be my recommendation as this is the most game realistic scenario.\n\n\nIn a 5v5 setting you need to highlight what makes you effective in 1v1. If its your shot making then you need to shoot the ball quickly and not mess around in 5v5 because there is help defense all over the place.\n\nIf it's driving then attack immediately off the catch in 5v5 and cut when you notice your defender's head is turned.\n\nThe name of the game of 5v5 is attacking space as efficiently as possible. Once you view the game from that lens, I think youll figure out things from there. In 1v1 youre given all the space. How can you use your current skills in an efficient way to attack what little space you have? How can you give yourself as much space as possible to attack in 5v5? What influences help defenders to take away the space and how can you exploit it? Are you always ready to attack the moment you get the ball to be efficient? Are you able to identify when your primary defender is out of position and exploit that immediately? Are you able to identify instanly where the help defense is at and how to exploit when theyre out of position? Do you know what being out of position even means??? Think critically on all of this and be honest with yourself. \n\nIn 1v1 youre fighting to get your defender out of position but alot of times in 5v5 you do alot of stuff without even dribbling to get your primary defender out of position and the bigger problem is the help defense and seeing if theyre out of position.",

Yeah, if the local playground is know for drugs and violence, don't send your 10 year old there by themselves. But sometimes you just gotta let the kids go out and play by themselves.\n\nMy bigger point is that adults and parents are too involved in their children's playtime. I'm gonna sound like a old man yelling at clouds, but when I was a kid, we went out and played whatever we wanted. We organized our own games and activities. Our parents had no idea what we were up to ... they just trusted that if there was a major problem, we'd find a responsible adult to help out.\n\nGetting back to sports development, does it really matter for the vast majority of kids? What is the end goal of all of this? \n\nWhen my kids were little, we signed them up for Rec League Soccer. The goal wasn't to develop my kids to be the next Mia Hamm, it was to let them burn off energy, play with their friends (and other new kids from the area), and learn a little teamwork. Most of these kids didn't even like soccer as 99% of them didn't touch a soccer ball outside of the one game a week. It was basically socializing.\n\nSo what if OP's kid is getting yelled at by a crappy coach. Address it with the coach or the league. Pull the kid out if you don't agree. If the kid is just playing for fun (no problem with that) and the coach is sapping the fun out of it, let the kid quit this team.

If your kid is in a wide age range group, i.e let's say a group of kids 10-14yo, the program probably caters more towards the top half. A 14yo beginner vs a 10yo beginner but the same program, 10 push ups might be no issue for a fit 12-14yo, might not suit a 10yo. But, if they're all 10yo beginners, then it's moot. Like I said, I don't know the exact situation/context, and as I've said, 10 is a bit much, but some is needed and not abnormal. Abnormal would be simply to do whatever.\n\nMy believe is that if the coach or the player are incompatible, they should change to another. You're demanding the coach to change his ways because in your opinion, his way/method/approach is wrong. I really don't mean to point this out, but it's essentially a \"i'm going to tell you how to do your job\" situation. Yeah, I can see the angry parents down votes incoming. Perhaps change to a different club/coach? Personally, that's what I'd recommend to do, as a player, as a coach, and as a parent. To be clear, I'm not against you, nor with the coach. Just pointing out what you're doing in case you're unaware. And again 10 might be a bit much. No dog in the fight. **BOTH WRONG to a certain extent**.\n\nWhen you say \"punishment shouldn't be exercise related\"... what do you mean? Example? Genuine question. Genuinely curious to learn.\n\nI get it's really hard to coach young kids. Coach really need to cater/custom fit the program. Not all coach are the same. And not all kids are the same level. Have you considered that he really just wanted to play ball for fun? If he wants to play ball to beat/compete with his older brother, he has to sacrifice and put serious effort into the boring work. It's boring, undeniably boring, but essential for strong fundamentals to build from.  \n\n\nWhoa! Your older son plays for the BEST NATIONAL TEAM! in your area. Which country is it? I'm way way out of the league (nowhere near national level at any age/player or coach). I'm amazed that throughout his journey none of his coaches ever meted out any form of punishment. Frankly I find it hard to believe, but different times eh. Logistics? Kids not together? Can send one there, but not the other?",
