## Inspiration 

> This project is currently being built during the (Storyblok x Code and Coffee Hackathon 2025)[https://storyblok-code-coffee.devpost.com/] event.

While working with content editors, Iâ€™ve observed that they often turn to Reddit discussions to gain authentic insights into industry challenges, user pain points, and product experiences. Conversational AI models can play a valuable role here by aggregating large volumes of discussions and analyzing them to extract actionable insights such as SEO keywords, emerging trends, and sentiment.
